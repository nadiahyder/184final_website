<h2 align="middle">Project Description:</h2>

<p>We want to build on our pathtracer to model light interactions with thin film surfaces. The ultimate goal is to support rendering of iridescent objects.</p>

<h2><b>Progress:</b></h2>
<p> So far we are fairly on track with our original timeline presented in our project proposal including:</p>
<p>    - Reading research papers to understand light, thinfilm, how they interact, and how to estimate the interference that leads to the rainbow effect </p>
<p>    - Altering .dae files such as CBspheres.dae and CBbunny.dae from project 3 to include thin film materials and effects </p>
<p>    - Updating the collada file from project 3 to be able to parse our new thin film effects in our XML files </p>
<p>    - Created a new BSDF type called ThinfilmBSDF with sample_f functions as well as a helper function to calculate the intensity for reflected and
  transmitted light based on the estimated interference patterns for red, green and blue wavelengths </p>

<h2> <b>Next Steps:</b></h2>
<p>We are mostly on track with our original plan and slightly ahead of schedule. We’ve finished a basic implementation and are able to render images that are somewhat close to our final goal. For example, here is an image of a hollow, transparent, thin film sphere (essentially a soap bubble):</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="images/image.png" align="middle" width = 400px/>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>It is showing the rainbow effect near the edges and looks relatively realistic. Another goal we have is to vary the thickness of the bubble vertically to achieve a more realistic look. We would also like to support rendering of solid objects like the dragon or bunny with a thin film over top. This will require alterations for more .dae files and possibly refinements to our code.</p>


<h2> <b>Updated Plan:</b></h2>
<p>    - By 5/1: Implement varying thickness of the soap bubble</p>
<p>    - By 5/1: Figure out why there are shadows underneath our transparent bubbles</p>
<p>    - By 5/3: Continue creating more thin film .dae files to render</p>
<p>    - Start writing final report and preparing presentation this week and update it as we go along</p>
